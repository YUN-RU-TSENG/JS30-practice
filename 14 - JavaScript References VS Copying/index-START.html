    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // Let's say we have an array
    
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const playSliceCopy = players.slice()
    const playConcatCopt = [].concat(players)
    const playSpeardCopt = [...players]
    const playArrayFrom = Array.from(players)

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const personCopy = Object.assign({}, person)
    const personCopy = Object.assign({}, person,{age: 12})
    const personDeepClone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))

    // and think we make a copy:
    // 比較深拷貝、淺拷貝
    // 比較 slice()、[...]、concat()、Array.from()、assign()

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
