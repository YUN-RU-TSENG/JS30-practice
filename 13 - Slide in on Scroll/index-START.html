        We now know which EXO member makes the most money and which one makes
        the least. Assuming, that is, the boys were telling the truth when they
        spilled the beans during an episode of Korean TV talk show, Radio Star,
        on Thursday (Dec 4).

        The six active members of the group – Suho, Baekhyun, Kai, Chanyeol,
        Sehun and Kim – appeared on the show.It started when the hosts brought
        up the fact that Suho and Baekhyun had named themselves as EXO's biggest
        earners.
      </p>
      <p>
        He added: “So they’ll say, ‘Suho, I heard you’re doing a musical? Treat
        us to a meal!’ and I’ll say, ‘But you did such-and-such solo activity
        recently.’ Then they’ll say, ‘Oh, but I did that for free.'”
      </p>
      <p>
        He clarified that the difference between the members may not be a lot.
        He said: “To be honest, it’s not like one member earns a lot less than
        the others or one member has a much higher income. But some members have
        released solo albums and things like that.”
